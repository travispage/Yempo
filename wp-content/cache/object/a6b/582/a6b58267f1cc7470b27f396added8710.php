Unknown to many, the Philippines has been an active player in <a href="http://www.rappler.com/brandrap/stories/98207-bpo-philippines-timeline">the outsourcing industry</a> since the early 1990's. Its exponential growth in this decade has resulted in the country topping the list as a <a href="http://www.manilatimes.net/philippines-the-new-call-center-capital-of-the-world/47984/">prime outsourcing location</a> in 2010.

One of the main reasons why the Philippines is a top choice for foreign companies is the countryâ€™s compatibility with Western Culture.

The Philippines is one of the worldâ€™s largest English-speaking nations. In fact, the country has topped the Business English Index, a whitepaper released by Global English, for two consecutive years for English competency in the workplace.

As English is the primary language of business, it is easy to see why many international global outsourcing companies hire qualified staff from the Philippines.
<h3><strong>The time difference is not a problem</strong></h3>

One of the main issues often faced by overseas companies is the time-difference. This is not an issue in the Philippines. Local employees have very flexible working hours so they can accommodate their clients' needs, regardless of location.
<h3><strong>We have a wide selection of talented people..</strong></h3>

Work ethic is an important element that you should consider when outsourcing in other countries. You do not want to jeopardize your company's integrity and reputation by working with unethical individuals. Filipinos pride themselves on their values of integrity, honesty, and loyalty.
<h2><strong>What Are the Best Practices forÂ Outsourcing in the Philippines?</strong></h2>

<strong>Identify the jobs you need to outsource</strong>

The first step to outsourcing is to identify the skills you need in order to release your own staff.Â  This will give you control over the quality of talent that you acquire for your business. Many outsourcing experts recommend that you outsource back-end positions that do not directly involve your customers.Â  Find out which department in your company needs additional help in order to finish pending tasks as this will narrow down your choices.
<h3><strong>Employ staff Western managed, highly motivated offices</strong></h3>

One of the secrets to maintaining the same high-quality, Western-based delivery of products and services is through employee motivation. The best way to achieve this is to place them in an office environment that enhances their motivation and productivity, along withÂ <a href="http://www.yempo-solutions.com/blog/managing-morale-during-outsourcing/">boosting their morale</a>.Â  Selecting a Western-managed office is key to ensuring that your outsourced employees deliver the same quality that you expect in your own business.
<h3><strong>Find the right outsourcing company</strong></h3>
The most crucial step for outsourcing the right staff is choosing the <a href="http://www.yempo-solutions.com/">correct outsourcing company</a>.Â  There are many companies that will claim they will hire the right people for your business, but before you sign up for their services, do thorough research. Never limit your research to their company information and on-site reviews. Visit other site reviews and, if you can, interview key individuals from companies who have worked with them.Â  You also want to aim for transparency when choosing an outsourcing company. You want to make sure that there are no hidden costs, that the cost model is very clear, and expenses are passed through with no markups.

Now that you know more about outsourcing in the Philippines, it might be time for you to start looking at your daily operations to see whether outsourcing would be worthwhile for you.
