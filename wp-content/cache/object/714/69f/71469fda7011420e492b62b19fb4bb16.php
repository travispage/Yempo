<h2 style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Freelancing </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Freelancing service gives the freedom to choose any worker from the pool of talents around the globe. It involves individual persons working on a contract or per project basis. To hire a freelancer, the employer just needs to post the job with its description and required skills on the websites. He can select any of the freelancers who meet his job description and skills at an affordable price. Even small business owners prefer freelancers to complete their job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Freelancing allows the employer to select fresh freelancers for his project. The employer hires the freelancer on a contract basis for a particular time duration. Therefore, freelancing is preferable for short term jobs and in terms of cost, it is also the best option available. Employers donâ€™t need to pay the freelancer when he sits idle. In addition, the employer only pays when the project gets completed, so the employer knows what work he is paying for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Freelancing has certain disadvantages. Sometimes, the employer hires a freelancer who does not possess the skills required for his project.Â  Such incidents give them bad experience in freelance hiring. This happens because interviews are not done in person. The absence of hiring checks and balance is also responsible for this problem. In some cases, hiring a freelancer for multiple jobs becomes a difficult task to manage. The employer has no control over the freelancer. Also, while working with freelancers, the employer knows nothing about the freelancer.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Home-based Employee</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Companies do hire employees who work directly from their homes according to their needs. Working from home has some advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working from home saves travelling cost and time. The employee gets the freedom to work according to his/her schedule. He has flexible environment and time. This lessens stress and distractions and they can focus more on their work. This even improves the health of the employee as he can work according to his flexibility.

Home based working eliminates the need of office dress codes which might be uncomfortable. Also, the employee can give their time, which is saved from travelling, to their families.</p>

This also separates us from the competitive environment of the office which is helpful to boost our productivity. Depending on the home environment, working at home sometimes causes more distractions than the office environment. Employees who work regularly from home may face difficulty in separating work life from home life.Â  He loses the discipline he gets in the office. Despite the fact that working from home saves travelling cost, it can also result in increased utility bills from using air conditioners. Home-based working also reduces face to face communication with our team leaders or members.</p>
