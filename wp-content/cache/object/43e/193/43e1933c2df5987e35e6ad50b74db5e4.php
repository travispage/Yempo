On Saturday 19<sup>th</sup> December, the weary Cebu team headed to the Childrensâ€™ Joy Foundation, an orphanage in nearby Talamban.
Childrenâ€™s Joy Foundation Inc. is a non-profit organization that originally provided basic needs like food, clothes, and education to destitute children. They expanded their services with community-based programs such as feeding programs for malnourished children in poor areas, free medical and dental services, livelihood projects to the beneficiariesâ€™ parents and scholarship grants to poor children who could not afford to go to school.

In the Talamban branch, there are 20 children under 15 years old. Most of these children came from the streets; some were adopted by the foundation because their parents could not afford to provide the daily basic needs; some have drug addicted parents. They are given food (3 meals per day), shelter, clothing, schooling (tuition, books, uniforms), and love and care from their head mistress and other staff.

The Yempo team delivered lunch and snacks, clothes, shoes and toys, and a 25 kg sack of rice. The children sang and danced for us and were very excited with the gifts.

<h2>Update for the Yempo Foundation</h2>
the Yempo Foundation we planned to launch has been put on hold. Instead, weâ€™ve teamed with an existing foundation as they change peopleâ€™s lives with their children'sâ€™ feeding program.

We seek your engagement and commitment to help make a real and lasting difference. Our plans to launch our own Foundation have been set aside for the time being while we work with Present Group, an Australian company that has a foundation in the Philippines supporting underprivileged school children.

Currently,Â 300 children are provided with a hot meal each day at the Inawayan School in Cebu, the program is designed to meet the most basic of human needs and aimed at giving children the chance to focus on school instead of the pain of hunger. The attendance and learning results speak for themselves and at the small cost of just 0.75 AUD per child per day or less than the cost of 1 coffee a week, you can make a measurable positive impact to a young child's life.

If you would like to know more or donate, please ask me â€“ you can provide a daily meal for a child for a full year for less than AUD$130 per annum. You can sponsor 1, 5, 10 children or more. Contact me directly on mf@yempo-solutions.com.

100% of funds donated go to supporting the children.
