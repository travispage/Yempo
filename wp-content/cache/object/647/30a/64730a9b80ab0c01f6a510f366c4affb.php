<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, companies are already complaining that a significant drop in the number of applicants has been registered. The words skilled labor shortfall are everywhere and is strongly suggested by the media. These changes require a rethinking of personnel management. Thus, the youthful delusion cannot be sustained. In addition, older workers have to be retained for a longer period of time which is still a common practice in many groups. In addition, good employees should be tied to the company in the long term through individual measures. In addition, it is necessary to extend the recruitment spectrum to the elderly, migrants, disabled, long-term unemployed and other personnel circles in order to maintain a company's ability and knowledge, despite excretions and immigration</p>
Following are some strategic ways to increase employee retention while reducing costs:

<strong>Attractive and Challenging Tasks and Work:</strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Exciting, challenging, interesting and varied tasks that enable employees to demonstrate their skills and talents, achieve visible results and successes, know the meaning and contribution to the company's entirety, and "get on their jobs" are among the most important binding factors of all. If they are credible, it often takes only a few binding measures. Depending on the level of education, talents, personalities and motivation profiles, however, the commitment to the work can also be individual and different depending on the task, the goal, and the project. To offer attractive tasks and work is a question of the management, the organization and flexibility, and the offers of personal development. This allows employees to be very effective and, above all, sustainable.</p>
<strong>Employee Leadership: </strong>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Always remember that the most effective and sustainable of all employee loyalty measures is the most cost-effective: leadership personality and leadership behavior of the direct supervisor. They do not have to be top managers, but have some, i.e. not all, of the competencies that decisively influence employee loyalty:</p>

<ul>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Positive human image</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Appreciation and praise of achievements</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Talent-oriented support</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Providing challenges and interesting tasks</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Inclusion in decisions and opinions</li>
 	<li style="text-align: justify;">Active co-operation with the necessary free rooms</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Employees should also know who they are to whom and what contribution they make. Purposeful activities, goals, and perspectives are of great importance, especially for demanding employees who expect more than one full paycheck and a secure workplace. In the case of prospects, it is mainly career and development aspects, and goals help as a guiding tool for goals. Whether employees experience their work as meaningful has a lot to do with corporate culture, which characterizes the daily life of the company and the handling of employees among one another and is expressed in values such as respect, trust, appreciation, honesty, and credibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Decision-Making and Co-Operation Possibilities:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Good specialists would like to identify with their work, would like to take over their own area of responsibility and act as an initiative. Employee loyalty measures are:</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>The transfer of responsibility in the performance of tasks,</li>
 	<li>The granting of free rooms with creative potential and</li>
 	<li>The voice in the company.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These measures also promote self-employment, productivity and the willingness to perform, while the tasks with little room for maneuver tend to be de-motivating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Flexible Working Hours and Working Time Models:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even today and in the future, attractive and flexible working time models are one of the biggest advantages of employer attractiveness with considerable influence on employee loyalty. If you want to attract employees to your company or attract new specialists, innovative work-time models are almost indispensable. Employees, who are able to influence the distribution of their working hours on their own responsibility, are more motivated - as evidenced by surveys. A flexible working time is often one of the most important reasons to remain faithful to a company. Employees have longer periods, can influence the course of their work and take more private and family interests into account.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Work Content and Work Organization:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Applicants are looking for companies that best fit their needs. Employees remain with those who offer good organizational and structural framework conditions for successful work as well as their personal basic values and life goals. The instruments that employ companies to shape their work, work environment, and work organization are part of a successful retention management and are measures of employee retention.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The management system of the company should be published transparently and authentically as a management philosophy. This includes the use of modern management tools and the taking over of management tasks such as:</p>

<ul style="text-align: justify;">
 	<li>Transfer of responsibilities</li>
 	<li>Feedback</li>
 	<li>Appraisal interview</li>
 	<li>Goal agreement on development opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, it is very crucial to increase employee retention today as the competition for qualified personnel will become increasingly stronger in the near future. As a result, companies are already intensifying the training and further education of their employees. Already more than every second company is already focusing on its own young talents and on the qualification of the in-house staff.</p>
