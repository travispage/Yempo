Â  What is offshoring? What is outsourcing? Which is Yempo?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong>Â  Â Offshoring is where you set up your own office in a lower-cost location and manage all the intricacies of establishing and running a company in a foreign country. The staff you hire belong to your company and are subject to your companyâ€™s rules and regulations as well as local government compliance. Offshoring is typically not cost effective for small businesses.
Outsourcing is where you allocate roles or tasks to a third party organization and they source the skills wherever they are best located.Â Yempo offers the best of both worlds â€“ no need for you to worry about establishing an offshore presence, but the staff we hire on your behalf are 100% dedicated to your work.

<strong>Q. Â  Am I taking jobs away from my own country? Iâ€™d prefer to support my localÂ economy.</strong>

<strong>A.</strong>Â  Â Many of the roles and activities that small businesses choose to outsource are typically not desirable for your high cost staff to be doing, and you are paying a premium for them to undertake lower value work. In addition, outsourcing a portion of your headcount keeps your business in the game, not subject to the highly competitive activities of larger companies already benefiting from operating in low-cost locations. It also enables you to focus on building your business, which drives more income into your local economy.

&nbsp;

<strong>Q. Â  Donâ€™t I need to fire staff to make offshoring pay for itself?</strong>

<strong>A.</strong> Â  Â We donâ€™t recommend you take this approach. Once you look at the activities that some of your highly paid local staff are performing, you will realize that their time can be put to much better use performing higher value activities, making them happier, more productive, and likely to contribute to increasing your sales. When staff leave by natural attrition, you could consider replacing them in an offshore location instead of in your own office. If they donâ€™t have regular face to face contact with your customers and they are not required to be in your country for compliance purposes, their role can be considered for offshoring.
